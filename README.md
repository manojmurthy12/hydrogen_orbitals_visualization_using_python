# orbitals-of-hydrogen
it's a project to simulate the probability of electrons in different orbitals and orbits.
from the wavefunctions of electrons in different orbitals,probabilities of electrons in that position  are calculated  and then they are scattered using the plotly module to give a visualization of different orbitals of hydrogen atom.
